# aws-data-lab

This repository is a personal lab focused on exploring projects with data and AWS.  

The `cdk_data_pipeline` directory contains an implementation that demonstrates a complete workflow:  
1. Extracts information from a public API.  
2. Stores it in the cloud in a format prepared for analysis.  
3. Makes it available through a data catalog and interactive queries.
